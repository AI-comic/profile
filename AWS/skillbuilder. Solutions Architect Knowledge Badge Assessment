 (v)4) Provisioned IOPS SSD - io1

7. A solutions architect must find the gateway that a database in an Amazon EC2 instance on a private subnet that can initiate a session to the internet, but must not allow a session from the internet to initiate back to the database.What gateway is it recommended to use for this private subnet directly for this behavior for the Internet connectivity?
    1) Virtual Private Gateway
 (v)2) NAT Gateway
    3) Direct Connect Gateway
    4) Transit Gateway

8. An IT organization is looking for a way to migrate their container workloads to the cloud to reduce administrative and maintenance tasks. Their Windows workloads are the highest priority to migrate onto AWS, and convenience and ease is the top priority to free up administrative time. Which AWS managed service will meet your companys requirements?
    1) Amazon ECS
 (v)2) AWS Fargate
    3) AWS Lambda
    4) Amazon EKS

9. The publicly accessible website hosted on Amazon EC2 instance in GovCloud region is able to communicate with Amazon S3. Amazon DynamoDB within the same region is also able to access Amazon S3 buckets. However, the Amazon RDS database instance that uses a private subnet of a Amazon VPC hosted in the same region is unable to send SNS notifications to Amazon S3. Which one of the following would you use to resolve the problem?
 (v)1) VPC Endpoint
    2) Virtual Private Gateway
    3) Direct Connect Gateway
    4) AWS Transit Gateway

10. A company is developing a highly available web application using stateless web servers. Which service is most suitable for storing ephemeral session state data?
    1) Amazon S3
 (v)2) Amazon ElastiCache
    3) Amazon DynamoDB
    4) Storage Gateway

11. A company has an On-Demand Amazon EC2 instance with an attached Amazon EBS volume. There is a scheduled job that creates a snapshot of this EBS volume at 12 AM when the instance is not used. You have a production incident where you need to perform a change on both the instance and on the EBS volume at the same time when the snapshot is currently taking place. Which of the following scenarios is valid when it comes to the usage of an EBS volume while the snapshot is in progress?
    1) The Amazon EBS volume can't be detached or attached when a snapshot is in progress.
 (v)2) The Amazon EBS volume can be used when the snapshot is in progress.
    3) The Amazon EBS volume cannot be used when a snapshot is in progress.
    4) The volume can be used in read only mode when a snapshot is in progress.

12. Your company is looking to store session information from their backend Amazon EC2 instances and they want to identify the best database which can provide them durability, high availability (HA), scalability and persistence. Since they want to store session information, they want a database which can provide them microsecond latency.Which one of the following database can best satisfy the requirements?

14. Your company uses an Identity Provider (IdP) for Single-sign on (SSO) and has tasked their solutions architect with connecting their AWS Account to the IdP so their users can leverage their corporate identity to access the environment. What actions should the solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Select TWO)

 (v)3) Create an AWS IAM Role with a trust relationship with the IdP.
 (v)4) Create an AWS IAM Identity Provider by uploading the SAML metadata document from your IdP.
    5) Create an AWS IAM User Group, associate the User Group with the IdP and add users to the User Group.

15. VPC Peering between two Amazon VPCs has just been activated and accepted. After that a solutions architect finds that they still have no communication between the workloads that are in both VPCs. What additional step can help to provide effective communication between VPCs?

    2) Additional configurations need to be made directly in VPC Peering.
 (v)3) Edit both route tables on the Amazon VPCs to add routes to the other VPC to which you want to connect.
    4) A Transit Gateway needs to be added between both VPCs to allow communication.
