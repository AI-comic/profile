1. which statement best describes how generative AI works?
    1. Generative AI is gevorend by a set of rules defined by the user.
    2. Generative AI is based on users labeling data, training model, and then deploying the model. This process is repeated for each specific task.
    3. Generative AI requires less data than traditional machine learning models.
 (v)4. Generative AI is powered by large ML models called foundation models, of FMs. With Fms, customers can use the same pre-trained model to adapt to multiple tasks.
